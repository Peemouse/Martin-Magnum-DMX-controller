DMX and artnet controller for fog machine Martin Magnum 850/1200

This custom ESP32-based controller adds DMX/ArtNet/sACN connectivity to a Martin Magnum 850 or 1200 (tested only on 850).

You may find in this repo :
- Schematics, gerber files and BOM for building the hardware
- Firmware
- 3D files for printing a dedicated box to be added onto the Martin Magnum 850 fog machine

Note :
Even if the board has been designed to work with Ethernet connectivity, only wired DMX is working as the first step of this project.
